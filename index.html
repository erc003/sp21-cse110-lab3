                            Mondays aren't <i>too</i> interesting, because I only have to attend the discussion for CSE 110. Luckily for me, there was <b>no</b> discussion on Monday, so I just got a 3 day weekend. I should note here that <strong>my memory is <em>terrible</em></strong>, so I honestly don't really remember what I did. I did find this funny video though. <strong>Warning: the audio is a bit loud.</strong>

Hopefully that's the worst side-effect that I experience. As I'm currently writing this journal entry, I'm trying to think about what I want to do after I finish this lab.</p>
