                            Mondays aren't <i>too</i> interesting, because I only have to attend the discussion for CSE 110. Luckily for me, there was <b>no</b> discussion on Monday, so I just got a 3 day weekend. I should note here that <strong>my memory is <em>terrible</em></strong>, so I honestly don't really remember what I did. I did find this funny video though. <strong>Warning: the audio is a bit loud.</strong>

                    <h2>Wednesday, April 7, 2021</h2>
                    <p>I got my <a href = "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/janssen.html">J&J Vaccine</a> this morning and my left arm feels a bit sore. Hopefully that's the worst side-effect that I experience. As I'm currently writing this journal entry, I'm trying to think about what I want to do after I finish this lab.</p>
                    <h3>Things I'll probably do after this lab:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Shower</li>
                        <li>Check school sites (Piazza, Canvas, Slack)</li>
                        <li>
                            Chill out, because tomorrow is Thursday (yuck)
